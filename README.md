# StateLegalDocAnalysis_NewsroomTool
A customized, reusable newsroom text analysis tool that allows reporters to compare similar language across state and federal bills, and also compare to related topic language of key industry players and lobbying group documents. This can allow reporters to quickly analyze key influences in a particular legal issue, pulling in documents like hearing testimony, product advertisements for grant funding investments, and more.


This tool uses semantic embeddings to compare legal documents and identify similarities in legislative language. It converts PDFs of state bills, federal provisions, industry documents, and lobbying materials into vector embeddings using a legal-specific AI model. Users can analyze how closely state legislation aligns with federal language, industry priorities, or lobbying group proposals, with similarity scores ranging from 0-100%. The tool can compare individual documents (like a state's budget vs. narrative), compare entire states to each other, or rank which states have the most similar legislative approaches. This enables journalists and researchers to detect potential copying of model legislation, trace lobbying influence, and identify regional patterns in lawmaking.
